## Abstract

Checks and assertions are an essential part of writing R code in data analysis.
We want to make sure that our code is getting the kinds of inputs we expect,
and giving the kinds of outputs we intend… and if something goes wrong we want
it to tell us!

Often, the default error messages that R provides are fine and helpful.
But as a developer of code for other people to use, you might want to take control
of the error messages that your users might see.

You might wish to provide useful context, a suggestion of what they might want to
do to fix or avoid the issue, or an example of the input or data point that
triggered the error.
And you might want your error messages to _look nice_ as well!
Investing in writing custom error messages might sound like a waste of time but it
signals to your users that you’ve thought about this, it can reduce user
frustration, and it’s useful for your own debugging as well.

This talk will briefly show some ways in which functions from the {cli} package can
help with preparing and formatting custom error messages.
