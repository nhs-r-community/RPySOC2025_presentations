# Declarations

- [ ] I've read the repository README.
- [ ] I've seen the LICENSE used in this repository and understand that this will apply to my slides.
- [ ] I'll add my slides* to the `talks` folder and name them in the form `2025-11-DD_surnames_presentation-title`, where `DD` is the date the presentation was given (`13` or `14`).

*If you would rather add a link to your slides, please create a simple markdown and add that to the `talks` folder instead. Example: https://github.com/nhs-r-community/conference-2025/blob/main/talks/2025-11-13_davies_qa.md
